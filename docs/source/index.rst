=================================

Autonomously driving equation discovery, from the micro to the macro, from
laptops to supercomputers.



Tutorials and Documentation
===========================
At the top of this page, see the "Getting Started" tab for installation help; the
"Tutorials" section has some explained high-level examples of the library. Finally,
all exported functions are documented in the "Manual".

This library would not have been possible without the excellent `PySR` library
(https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR) which forms the core of the equation
discovery subroutine; if you use MedEQ in your work, please also cite:
