All public ``medeq`` subroutines are fully documented here, along with copy-pastable
examples. The `base` functionality is summarised below. You can also use the
`Search` bar in the top left to go directly to what you need.

We really appreciate all help with writing useful documentation; if you feel
something can be improved, or would like to share some example code, by all means
get in contact with us - or be a superhero and click `Edit this page` on the right
and submit your changes to the GitHub repository directly!
